debian 9.3 bug #835822: mac address randomization breaks WiFi with various drivers

psuedo fix:

#edit NetworkManager config file:
sudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

#add the following lines:

[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

# restart service
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
